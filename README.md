# SQL Homework - Employee Database: A Mystery in Two Parts


## Introduction

Create a script file to build each CSV file from the Resource folder into the corresponding SQL tables and population of their data.

Create a script file to display data output based on following 8 criteria:

1. List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.


2. List first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.


3. List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name.


4. List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.


5. List first name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."


6. List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.


7. List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.


8. In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.


In the second part of this assignment, a Jupyter Notebook script is created to import those SQL tables into Pandas. And it will plot a histogram to visualize the most common salary ranges for employees and a bar chart of average salary by title.

Id 499942 is an employee having the name of April Foolsday hence I think the dataset is fake and it was an exercise to test new staff of their skills and expertise.

## Setup 

1. Download and extract the zip file

2. Open Terminal (on Mac) or Open Bash (on PC)

3. Navigate to the sql-challenge folder

4. Open the schema.sql file and it contains SQL statements that create all tables and populate all related data from the csv fiels in the EmployeeSQL folder.

5. Open the select.sql file and it contains SQL statements that display various output as stated from the eight criteria above.
